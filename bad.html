    hi! im just a kid... a high school kid. sometimes i like to program and
    things, but i don't really know. unfortunately i am also
    <a href="https://github.com/gengkev/thyroxine/issues/19">a nerd</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    here are some less terrible projects i have worked on.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>luvmarkdown</strong> &mdash; a web problem for tjctf 2016.
        i think only three teams solved it during the competition! it's kind
        of a convoluted problem, especially since the code <em>looks</em>
        pretty secure. (thanks, content security policy!) but of course, csp
        can't be a silver bullet. the exploit involves finding a subtle stored
        xss vulnerability, then using it to conduct a session fixation attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        to set it up on your own computer, install node and phantomjs, making
        sure that both are in the path. then run <code>node setup.js</code>
        and <code>node src/app.js</code>.
      </p>

      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>thyroxine</strong> &mdash; an android client for tjhsst
        intranet. i built this over a series of saturdays around winter 2014
        to spring 2015, and i've probably put more effort into it than any
        other project i've done. (coincidentally <a href="https://github.com/el1t/Iolite">iolite</a>
        was being developed around the same time, but that actually gained some
        user traction!)
      </p>
      <p>
        probably the most interesting thing that thyroxine can do is that it
        can synchronize data and store it offline. implementing that required
        a lot of mucking around with android sqlite and syncadapter and
        accountmanager and blagh. anyway i should probably update it to use
        ion instead of iodine sometime, but that will also take quite a bit of
        work.

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>fresh eats</strong> &mdash; a marketplace to sell homemade food.
        rohan suri and i built this during vthacks III (which took place from
        february 26 &ndash; 28, 2016). we won third place overall! the app
        doesn't exactly completely work yet, of course. it was built using the
        ionic framework, which uses angular.js, and firebase as a backend.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>instant recall</strong> &mdash; an app that notifies you when
        food items you purchase are recalled. eric wang, joseph chen, and i
        built this during incubatedc 2016 (which took place from august 6
        &ndash; 7, 2016), winning third place overall. the app lets you scan
        receipts to track what food products you purchase. then it
        cross-references those with data from the openfda api to determine
        whether any have been recalled. the app is built with hacky jquery.
      </p>
      <p>
        unfortunately, the receipt scanning is currently rather poor (stuffing
        it through ocr and matching the resulting text) and the openfda api
        only seems to be updated once every few months, prohibiting truly
        instant recall notifications. we would also want to integrate with data
        from USDA, which also issues recalls.
