You know, I really ought to be asleep. Fortunately setting up this website didn't take too long, but I've already spent a few hours migrating my former Google Code projects and writing commentary in the READMEs. Only afterwards did I realize that the Wiki was automatically copied over, in the `wiki` branch of each project.

It's already Sunday, spring break is pretty much over, and I still have homework and USACO to do.

I'd better get cracking...
